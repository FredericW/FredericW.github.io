I am currently a research scientist working at the Tongyi Institute of Alibaba Group.

In the past, I was as a research fellow at the National University of Singapore from late 2022 to early 2024 (hosted by [Prof.Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/)), worked on developing of privacy-preserving techniques.

Before moving to Singapore, I worked as a postdoctoral research scholar at Arizona State University (hosted by [Prof.Lalitha Sankar](https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/) and [Prof.Oliver Kosut](https://sites.google.com/site/okosut/)), 
focused on the theoretical aspects of privacy-preserving techniques and network information theory.

My academic journey began with pursuing my PhD in Electrical Engineering at the State University of New York at Buffalo, under the guidance of [Prof.Michael Langberg](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~mikel/).

My research interests include but not limited to, machine learning, fairness, privacy and security, network information theory, fishing, cooking, and cat-petting.
