I am a research fellow at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore. I obtained PhD in Electrical Engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2020. Prior to joining NUS in 2022, I was a postdoctoral research scholar at Arizona State University (2020-2022).
My research interests include but not limited to, data privacy and security, network information theory, fishing, hiking, and cat-mastering.
