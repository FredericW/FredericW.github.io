I am a research fellow at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore working with [Prof.Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/). I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2020, advised by [Prof.Michael Langberg](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~mikel/). Prior to joining NUS in late 2022, I was a postdoctoral research scholar at Arizona State University (2020-2022) worked with [Prof.Lalitha Sankar](https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/) and [Prof.Oliver Kosut](https://sites.google.com/site/okosut/).

My research interests include but not limited to, fairness, privacy and security, network information theory, fishing, cooking, and cat-petting.
