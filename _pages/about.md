I am currently working as a research scientist at Alibaba Group. Before joining 
Alibaba, I held the position of research fellow at the National 
University of Singapore from late 2022 to early 2024, where I collaborated closely with
[Prof.Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/) on research 
topics regarding the privacy perspectives of learning and data. 

Prior to moving to Singapore, I served as a postdoctoral research scholar at Arizona State University from late 2020 to mid 2022, 
working alongside
[Prof.Lalitha Sankar](https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/) and 
[Prof.Oliver Kosut](https://sites.google.com/site/okosut/), mainly focused on the theoretical aspects of privacy-preserving techniques and network information theory.
My academic journey began with pursuing my PhD in Electrical Engineering 
at the State University of New York at Buffalo, under the guidance of
[Prof.Michael Langberg](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~mikel/).

My research interests include but not limited to, machine learning, fairness, privacy and security, network information theory, fishing, cooking, and cat-petting.
