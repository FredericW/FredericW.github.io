I am currently a research scientist at Alibaba Group. Prior to joining 
Alibaba on 2024, I held the position of research fellow at the National 
University of Singapore since 2022, where I collaborated closely with
[Prof.Xiaokui Xiao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/) on research 
topics regarding the privacy perspective of learning and data. 

Previously, I served as a postdoctoral research scholar at Arizona State University, 
working alongside
[Prof.Lalitha Sankar](https://sankar.engineering.asu.edu/) and 
[Prof.Oliver Kosut](https://sites.google.com/site/okosut/).
My academic journey began with my pursuing my PhD in Electrical Engineering 
from the State University of New York at Buffalo (luckily finished it on 
2020), under the guidance of
[Prof.Michael Langberg](https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~mikel/).

My research interests include but not limited to, fairness, privacy and security, network information theory, fishing, cooking, and cat-petting.
